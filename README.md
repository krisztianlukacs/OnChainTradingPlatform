# On-Chain Trading Platform

A decentralized platform for executing trading signals on the blockchain.

## Project Overview

This project implements an on-chain trading platform that allows for the secure transmission of trading signals to the blockchain and automated execution of trades based on those signals. The platform consists of three main components:

1. **Smart Contracts**: Solana programs written in Rust that handle signal validation and trade execution.
2. **Backend Service**: A Node.js service that generates trading signals and pushes them to the blockchain.
3. **Frontend Website**: A marketing website showcasing the platform's features and benefits.

## Architecture

The platform follows this architecture:

1. **Signal Generation and Pushing**:
   - Trading signals are generated by a cloud-based system
   - Signals are encrypted and pushed to the blockchain via an oracle

2. **Smart Contract Layer**:
   - Validates incoming signals
   - Triggers on-chain trading actions

3. **Trading Signal Handling**:
   - Verifies signal authenticity
   - Interacts with Jupiter Swap protocol for executing trades

4. **Trading Execution**:
   - Supports multiple trading accounts
   - Executes trades on Jupiter Swap

5. **Trade Management and Updates**:
   - Tracks trade status
   - Updates trader balances

6. **Security and Data Integrity**:
   - Ensures secure signal transmission
   - Maintains tamper-proof trading records

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo (for smart contracts)
- Node.js and npm (for backend and frontend)
- Solana CLI (for deploying and interacting with contracts)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/on-chain-trading-platform.git
   cd on-chain-trading-platform
   ```

2. Install dependencies for the backend:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the smart contracts:
   ```
   cd contracts
   cargo build-bpf
   ```

### Running the Project

1. Start the backend service:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open the frontend website:
   ```
   cd frontend
   # You can use any static file server, for example:
   npx serve
   ```

## Smart Contract Deployment

To deploy the smart contract to the Solana devnet:

1. Build the contract:
   ```
   cd contracts
   cargo build-bpf
   ```

2. Deploy the contract:
   ```
   solana program deploy target/deploy/on_chain_trading_platform.so
   ```

3. Update the `PROGRAM_ID` in the backend `.env` file with the deployed program ID.
